Hi, good afternoon! I hope this message finds you well.
I would like to know if I can place an order outside the USA. My boyfriend is turning 23 next Sunday, but I'm in Mexico City right now, 
and he is in Kansas. I would like to know about the prices and if I can buy from Mexico and you can deliver to him in Kansas, also, I wanna 
share with you which kind of cake I would like to have:

This is my main idea. I would like to have the same result respecting also the colors and shape, and, if you can include this type of personalized
letters in the top of the cake, could be great (sugar letters on the top also work for me, so it's not a big deal!).
About the flavor, I would like to have raspberry as the first option, and in case it's not possible, strawberry could be okay too. 
If you can include white chocolate inside or as part of the icing, that could be the final touch to have my boyfriend's perfect cake.  

Please let me know if I can place this order with you, I would love to!

Thank you so much for your time and attention! Have a nice day!


I won't be present in the moment of delivery, so please mention my name and room number in the hotel lobby and they will receive the package for me (Anil Avci, 
room number 112). Please ask them to put my cake into the fridge. Thank you! :)
